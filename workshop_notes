COPERNICUS HACKATON
===================

Sentinel 1
    - radar technology
    - works even in cloudy weather
    - pair satelite, revisit time is 2-3 days
    - all globe sensing
    - detecting surface and moisture levels
    - 10 to 20 meters resolution

Sentinel 2
    - visual spectrum, IR bands
    - good to recognize invisible features (vegetation, ...)
    - pair satellite, revisit time 3-5 days
    - 1px is 10x10 meters (not all bands are in this resolution, some are also 20x20 or 60x60)
    - most data is from 2016 onwards
    - doesn't see through the clouds
    - Brno -> only ~40 images a year

Sentinel 3
    - meant for ocean monitoring
    - the resolution is very low
    - 100s of meters of kilometers (useful only for really large areas)

Sentinel 5p
    - working from 2018
    - monitoring the atmosphere
    - these measurements are usually done on the ground, this satellite allows us to have a larger area of measurement
    - the resolution is "horrible" -> 7x7km (one band is 3x3km)
    - national scale data

Sentinel 4 & 6 are not in space...

General
    - This data is spatial, it needs to have some coordinates. Otherwise, it is difficult to place on the surface.
    - The satelites are not able to measure physical space. We just see reflected energies in certain wavelengths.
    - vegetation index -> red and near infrared spectrum, used for vegetation
    - others are water or moisture index

Data sources
    - Sentinel Hub (yes please)
    - AWS data (cloud computing) -> registry.opendata.aws
    - Copernicus Open Access Hub (most difficult to work with) -> very resource intensive
    - other (eg. NASA LandSat, ...) -> LandSat is better for temperature monitoring (100x100m resolution)

Sentinel Hub
    - Custom scripts (custom-scripts.sentinel-hub.com)
    - REST API (apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser) -> sentinelhub-py, eo-learn
    - EO Browser

Tools
    - QGIS (no programming, working with images)
    - EO Browser
